# Co-occurrance-Network
The network is designed to gauge the multi-linked relationship among keywords in the James Bond novel From Russia With Love. The nodes represent the particular keywords, whereas the edges represent a co-occurrence pattern in a sentence. Each edge has an attribute called weight, which signifies the frequency of the combination. The keywords are cherrypicked based on their vertex degrees. All stop words and punctuations are filtered out before processing natural language data.  The txt. file can be found here: https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20160104
